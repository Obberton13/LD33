Theme: You are the Monster

# THE IDEA:
Metroid-Vania Roguelike Survival
* Set map, start on the left, go right.
* Start as a human, gradually become less human
* Collect different attacks
* Collect upgrades
* Humans spawn off-screen constantly and increase in strength based on how many upgrades you have, and what upgrades you have.
* As you increase in size, the number of humans spawning will increase
	* 0 = 0 humans/second, 1 item = 1/second, 2 = 2/second, 50 = 50/second
* Humans are an insta-kill? Stronger ones may have armor that you will add an extra hit
* Special Attacks
	* Will have to be charged by picking up things the humans drop (missiles from metroid, but different)
* Start with 100 total health
	* Can collect health upgrades (10 total)
* Killing humans give health regeneration things and ammo
* You will see some obstacles at the beginning and won't be able to move them until you get the attacks later. (missile doors from prime)
	* Behind these obstacles are the health canisters/upgrades
* Wall at the top and bottom of the screen - humans jump off of this wall and attack


## Setting:
* Desert
* Forest
* Post-apocolyptic city
* Underwater
* Some of each? OOOOHH.

## Upgrades:
* Wings (ability to fly)
* Fins (ability to swim)
* IronSkin (swim through lava)
* Some sort of speed-increasing thing
	* Speed increases for each type of movement
* Health Canisters
* Each type of attack: see below

## Attacks:
* Sprays goo
	* toxic goo w/ upgrade
	* acid goo w/ upgrade that also melts through metal
* Constricts people with tentacles (you have 2)
* Special attacks?:
	* breath weapons:
		* fire (melts ice)
		* ice (freezes water)
		* water (put out fire, does nothing to lava)

## Obstacles:
* rivers
	* slow down until you have ice breath or fins
	* ice when frozen
* lakes
	* block you until you have ice breath or fins
	* ice when frozen
* lava
	* block you until you have water breath or ironskin
	* turns to normal land when you use water breath on it
* random junk
	* block you until you have fly
	* after you have fly, you still can't go off the top or bottom

## Abilities:
	* hide in plain sight
	* really fast sprint speed, but only lasts 2 seconds
